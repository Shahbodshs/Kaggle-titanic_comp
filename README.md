# Kaggle competition:
In the __code__ branch you can find the code file of a project thats for kaggle competitions for starters.
## Explanations: 
I tried to use algorithms like XGBoost and also Logistic regression, but for me turned out using the algorithm RF is actually a good approach for this task, since it gave a better results. 
Though im sure that using XGBoost algorithm must be a better option, but since it needs a careful hyperparameter tuning i need to give it a try later on, i will commit the updates here.
